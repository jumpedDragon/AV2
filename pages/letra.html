                <p>Black then white are all I see in my infancy <br>
                    Red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me<br>
                    Lets me see <br>
                    As below so above and beyond, I imagine <br>
                    Drawn beyond the lines of reason <br>   
                    Push the envelope, watch it bend <br>
                    Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind <br>
                    Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must <br>
                    Feed my will to feel my moment, drawing way outside the lines <br>
                    Black then white are all I see in my infancy <br>
                    Red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me <br>
                    Lets me see <br>
                    There is so much more  <br>
                    And beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities <br>
                    As below so above and beyond, I imagine <br>
                    Drawn outside the lines of reason <br>
                    Push the envelope, watch it bend <br>
                    Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind <br>
                    Withering my intuition leaving opportunities behind <br>
                    Feed my will to feel this moment <br>
                    Urging me to cross the line <br>
                    Reaching out to embrace the random <br>
                    Reaching out to embrace whatever may come <br>
                    I embrace my desire to <br>
                    I embrace my desire to <br>
                    Feel the rhythm, to feel connected <br>
                    Enough to step aside and weep like a widow <br>
                    To feel inspired <br>
                    To fathom the power <br>
                    To witness the beauty <br>
                    To bathe in the fountain <br>
                    To swing on the spiral <br>
                    To swing on the spiral to <br>
                    Swing on the spiral <br>
                    Of our divinity <br>
                    And still be a human <br>
                    With my feet upon the ground I lose myself <br>
                    Between the sounds and open wide to suck it in <br>
                    I feel it move across my skin <br>
                    I'm reaching up and reaching out <br>
                    I'm reaching for the random or whatever will bewilder me <br>
                    Whatever will bewilder me <br>
                    And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been <br>
                    We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been <br>
                    Spiral out, keep going <br>
                    Spiral out, keep going <br>
                    Spiral out, keep going <br>
                    Spiral out, keep going</p>

                        Why did Father give these humans free will?<br>
                        Now they're all confused<br>
                        Don't these talking monkeys know that<br>
                        Eden has enough to go around?<br>
                        Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys<br>
                        Where there's one, you're bound to divide it<br>

                        Father blessed them all with reason<br>

                        To beat their brother down<br>
                        How they've survived so misguided is a mystery<br>
                        Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability<br>
                        To lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here<br>
                        Gotta divide it all right in two<br>
